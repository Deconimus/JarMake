# JarMake
Jar compositor and builder with minimal need for configuration.

### Installation
Clone or download the repo to a directory of your choice and add an entry in your PATH variable that points to it.
An installation using pip may follow in the future.

### How To Use
After installing JarMake, create make.json files in your project directories (look at example.json or at make.json files in my public repositories, maybe I'll write a guide for those in the future).
For convenience, you can copy the make.py script into the project directories too, so you only have to run those to evoke a build.
